This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. It was created following the React documentation to help you understand the basics of building React applications.

## How to Play

# Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to place their marker (X or O) in an empty square.
The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If the board is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
